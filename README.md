# file_move_rename
Help for a friend

For context, testing was performed on Desktop folders test_source_folder and test_target_folder, on .txt files in both locations. There isn't any filtering to move files with a particular filename format but not others.

There are no unit tests, which should be implemented. If interested, use Python's built-in unittest module as a good place to start.
